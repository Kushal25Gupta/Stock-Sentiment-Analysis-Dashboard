# Project Roadmap: Advanced Stock Sentiment Analysis App

## Overview
This project integrates real-time stock data with advanced NLP techniques to analyze financial news and predict stock market movements. The final product will showcase not only basic data ingestion and sentiment analysis but also advanced features like fine-tuned models, aspect-based sentiment analysis, emotion detection, deep learning predictions, an interactive dashboard, and automated, containerized deployment.

## Phased Approach & Key Features

### **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
- **Real-Time Data Ingestion:**
  - Fetch stock data using yfinance.
  - Retrieve financial news headlines using NewsAPI.
- **Basic Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Use a default transformer pipeline for initial sentiment analysis.
- **Data Integration:**
  - Combine stock and sentiment data using Pandas.
- **Output Storage:**
  - Save results to CSV and text files.
- **Version Control & Documentation:**
  - Maintain best practices with Git, feature branching, and thorough documentation.

### **Phase 2: Advanced NLP Integration**
- **Fine-Tuning Domain-Specific Models:**
  - Collect a dataset of financial news and fine-tune a transformer (e.g., BERT) to improve sentiment accuracy.
- **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Analyze sentiment for specific financial aspects (e.g., earnings, management, market conditions).
- **Emotion Detection:**
  - Integrate an emotion detection model to capture a range of emotions (anger, joy, sadness, etc.) beyond binary sentiment.
- **Ensemble Methods (Optional):**
  - Combine predictions from multiple models to improve robustness and accuracy.

### **Phase 3: Deep Learning Prediction & Interactive Dashboard**
- **Deep Learning Prediction:**
  - Train an LSTM (or similar model) on historical stock data to forecast price movements.
- **Interactive Dashboard:**
  - Build a real-time web interface using Streamlit or React to display stock data, advanced sentiment/emotion analysis, and prediction results.

### **Phase 4: Distributed Streaming, Database Integration, & Automation**
- **Distributed Streaming:**
  - Implement Kafka or AWS Kinesis to handle continuous data streams.
- **Database Integration:**
  - Integrate SQL/NoSQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for efficient data storage and querying.
- **Workflow Automation:**
  - Use Airflow or Prefect to automate data pipelines, periodic model retraining, and data refreshes.

### **Phase 5: Containerization, Deployment & CI/CD**
- **Containerization & Orchestration:**
  - Containerize the application using Docker.
  - Orchestrate deployment using Kubernetes (local via Minikube or on a cloud platform).
- **CI/CD Integration:**
  - Set up continuous integration and delivery pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **Cloud Deployment:**
  - Deploy the fully integrated application to a cloud provider.

## Timeline & Milestones
- **Milestone 1:** Basic Data Ingestion & Sentiment Analysis (Completed)
- **Milestone 2:** Advanced NLP Integration (Fine-Tuning, Aspect-Based Analysis, Emotion Detection)
- **Milestone 3:** Deep Learning Prediction with LSTM & Interactive Dashboard Prototype
- **Milestone 4:** Distributed Streaming, Database Integration, and Workflow Automation
- **Milestone 5:** Containerization, CI/CD Setup, and Cloud Deployment

## Future Enhancements
- **Real-Time Adaptation & Online Learning:**  
  Enable models to continuously adapt by learning from new data in real time.
- **Enhanced Ensemble Strategies:**  
  Experiment with advanced ensemble methods to further boost prediction robustness.
- **User Feedback Integration:**  
  Implement mechanisms to collect user feedback to refine model predictions over time.
- **Extended Analytics:**  
  Incorporate additional data sources and advanced analytics for deeper market insights.
