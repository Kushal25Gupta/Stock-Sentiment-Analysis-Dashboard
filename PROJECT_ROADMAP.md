# Project Roadmap: Stock Sentiment Analysis App

## Overview
A Python-based application that fetches real-time stock data and news, performs sentiment analysis using NLP, and predicts stock price movements using deep learning. The final product includes an interactive dashboard and automated deployment.

## Requirements
1. Real-Time Data Ingestion:
   - Stock data via yfinance
   - News headlines via NewsAPI
2. Distributed Streaming:
   - Kafka/AWS Kinesis for real-time data processing
3. Sentiment Analysis:
   - NLP with transformer models (BERT/DistilBERT)
4. Deep Learning Prediction:
   - LSTM model for forecasting stock prices
5. Interactive Dashboard:
   - Web interface with Streamlit or React
6. Databases:
   - Integration with SQL/NoSQL (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
7. Automation & Deployment:
   - Workflow automation with Airflow/Prefect
   - Docker containerization and Kubernetes orchestration
