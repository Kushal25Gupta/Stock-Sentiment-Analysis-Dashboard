# Project Roadmap: Advanced Stock Sentiment Analysis App

## Overview
This project integrates real-time stock data with advanced NLP techniques to analyze financial news and predict stock market movements. The final product will include advanced sentiment and emotion analysis, a deep learning prediction model, and an interactive dashboard.

## Features & Enhancements
1. **Real-Time Data Ingestion**
   - Fetch stock data using yfinance.
   - Retrieve financial news headlines using NewsAPI.

2. **Advanced NLP Techniques**
   - **Fine-Tuning Domain-Specific Models:** Fine-tune a transformer model (e.g., BERT) on a dataset of financial news for more accurate sentiment analysis.
   - **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze sentiment for specific financial aspects such as earnings, management, and market conditions.
   - **Emotion Detection:** Detect a range of emotions (anger, joy, sadness, etc.) in news headlines.
   - **Ensemble Methods:** Optionally combine predictions from multiple models for increased accuracy.

3. **Deep Learning Prediction**
   - Train an LSTM model to forecast stock price movements based on historical data.

4. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - Build a web interface using Streamlit/React to display real-time data, sentiment analysis, and prediction results.

5. **Distributed Streaming & Database Integration**
   - Implement Kafka or AWS Kinesis for real-time data streaming.
   - Integrate SQL/NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for data storage and querying.

6. **Automation & Deployment**
   - Automate data pipelines and model retraining with Airflow/Prefect.
   - Containerize the application using Docker and orchestrate using Kubernetes.

## Timeline & Milestones
- **Milestone 1:** Basic Data Ingestion & Sentiment Analysis (Completed)
- **Milestone 2:** Advanced NLP Integration (Fine-Tuning, Aspect-Based Analysis, Emotion Detection)
- **Milestone 3:** Deep Learning Prediction with LSTM
- **Milestone 4:** Interactive Dashboard Development
- **Milestone 5:** Distributed Streaming, Database Integration, and Automation
- **Milestone 6:** Containerization and Cloud Deployment

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time adaptation and online learning for the NLP models.
- Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) for automated testing and deployment.
